# Network Performance Simulation and Analysis
 
Designed and implemented a simulation of an M/M/1 queuing system using Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. Analyzed system performance metrics across varying loads and arrival events to validate theoretical expectations.

Developed a simulation of TCP flows using AIMD congestion control with probabilistic packet loss and Go-Back-N retransmission. Evaluated fairness, throughput, and goodput under equal and different RTT scenarios.
